Porgrams done for "Computer Networks and Distributed Systems" subject from University of Sao Paulo

Each folder represent a different project. EP means "Exercicio Programa" in portuguese, and it can be translated by "Programming assingment".

# EP1

We had to code a simple FTP server, with some functionalities. This project had to be done in C.

# EP2

We had to do a program that would sort an array in a distributed fashion. It had some restrictions, such it had to implement leader election (even though it maybe unnecessary).

# EP3

We had to follow a tutorial to implement a switch and firewall with OpenFlow.

# EP4

In this assingment we had to explore a security breach, we choose to explore a CRLF of a specific golang version.
